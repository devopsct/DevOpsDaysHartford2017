# Venue Information

## Dates
Venues must be available for our requested dates. Right now I'm leaning on Oct-Nov, more in [Dates](/Dates.md). A Tu-Wed or Wed-Thurs is ideal.

Timing from about 8:00am (vendor setup) through 5:00pm

## Requirements
* Main Venue
** Seating for 250
* Breakout rooms for OpenSpaces
** 3-5 spaces
** Expected about 50% - 75% attendance
* AV
** Projector/Screen
** Sound

## Wishlist
* Catering for Breakfast/Lunch
* Catering for Coffee
* Lodging Space discounts
* Recording for AV available

## Inclusivity Concerns
These are ideals. It's possible to exclude these, but they're a nice touch towards inclusivity and should be considered highly:

* Available unisex bathrooms
* Child care
* Lactation rooms
* Dietary Restriction Accommodations
** Allergies
** Vegetarian
** Vegan
** Kosher

## Venue Notes

I'm separating Hartford and New Haven at the moment only because we still have the offer on the table from Yale which is incredibly cheap for a venue host. That said, pricing is not our only concern and I think we're mostly in agreement that Hartford is more convenient for those coming in from out of state (our speakers and sponsors without whom we cannot even have an event).
